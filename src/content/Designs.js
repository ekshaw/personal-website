        The YHWH Apparel website project explores a brand that empowers people to express their
        identity through their apparel. Profits generated from sales are dedicated to supporting
        various partnerships, embodying the brand's commitment to giving back and making a positive
        impact. The core audience of YHWH Apparel largely comprises students and young adults,
        reflecting a vibrant and socially conscious demographic eager to connect with faith-infused
        fashion. This project encompasses not only a website overhaul, but also a comprehensive
        rebranding strategy, introducing a new logo, typography, iconography, and color palette.

        intuitively and provide easy access to vital information. In addition to this, we created
        new visual elements to reflect the collective's energetic and sustainable ethos, refreshing

        To address the question, we studied similar cooperative websites to gather insights into

        Our goal was to translate research findings into actionable design concepts that would
        enhance the BSFC website's user experience. To address the issue of information overload, we
        brainstormed ideas to simplify the navigation structure. This involved reevaluating the
        existing website's page hierarchy and considering ways to combine related content into
        cohesive sections to reduce the number of pages. Our discussions revolved around the balance
        between providing comprehensive information and ensuring that users could easily digest and
